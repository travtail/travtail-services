                    <p>It is Travtail's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to all travtail domains (hereinafter, "us", "we", "https://travtail.app/", "https://travtail.ai/", "https://travtail.store/", or "https://travtail.com/"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

                    <p>Like most website operators, Travtail collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Travtail's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Travtail's visitors use its website. From time to time, Travtail may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<br> Travtail also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://travtail.com/ blog posts. Travtail only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://travtail.com/ to provide a username and email address.</p>

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
